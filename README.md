# Michael Soh's Public SSH Keys

This repository contains all of my SSH public keys.  The goal is to create an `authorized_keys` file that can be pulled through a script on an as-needed basis.

Public keys aren't necessarily copyrightable.  However, since they are useless without private keys, if a license is needed, all keys contained within the `public_keys/` directory are released via the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
