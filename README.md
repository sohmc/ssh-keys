# Michael Soh's Public Keys

This repository contains all of my public keys.  It used to be only SSH keys but now they also house my GPG/PGP public keys.

This repository automates the creation of an `authorized_keys` file of SSH authentication that can be pulled through a script on an as-needed basis.
